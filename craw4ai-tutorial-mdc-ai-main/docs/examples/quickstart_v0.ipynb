        "\n",

        "5. The strategy supports nested structures, lists within lists, and various data types.\n",
        "6. You can even include computed fields for more complex data manipulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "This approach allows for highly flexible and precise data extraction, transforming semi-structured web content into clean, structured JSON data. It's particularly useful for extracting consistent data patterns from pages like product listings, news articles, or search results.\n",
