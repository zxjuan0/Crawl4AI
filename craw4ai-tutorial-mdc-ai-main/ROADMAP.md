Crawl4AI is evolving to provide more intelligent, efficient, and versatile web crawling capabilities. This roadmap outlines the key developments and features planned for the project, organized into strategic sections that build upon our current foundation.

## 1. Advanced Crawling Systems üîß

This section introduces three powerful crawling systems that extend Crawl4AI's capabilities from basic web crawling to intelligent, purpose-driven data extraction.

### 1.1 Question-Based Crawler
The Question-Based Crawler enhances our core engine by enabling automatic discovery and extraction of relevant web content based on natural language questions.

Key Features:
- SerpiAPI integration for intelligent web search
- Relevancy scoring for search results
- Automatic URL discovery and prioritization
- Cross-source validation

```python
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler
from crawl4ai.discovery import QuestionBasedDiscovery

async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
    discovery = QuestionBasedDiscovery(crawler)
    results = await discovery.arun(
        question="What are the system requirements for major cloud providers' GPU instances?",
        max_urls=5,
        relevance_threshold=0.7
    )
    
    for result in results:
        print(f"Source: {result.url} (Relevance: {result.relevance_score})")
        print(f"Content: {result.markdown}\n")
```

### 1.2 Knowledge-Optimal Crawler
An intelligent crawling system that solves the optimization problem of minimizing data extraction while maximizing knowledge acquisition for specific objectives.

Key Features:
- Smart content prioritization
- Minimal data extraction for maximum knowledge
- Probabilistic relevance assessment
- Objective-driven crawling paths

```python
from crawl4ai import AsyncWebCrawler
from crawl4ai.optimization import KnowledgeOptimizer

async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
    optimizer = KnowledgeOptimizer(
        objective="Understand GPU instance pricing and limitations across cloud providers",
        required_knowledge=[
            "pricing structure",
            "GPU specifications",
            "usage limits",
            "availability zones"
        ],
        confidence_threshold=0.85
    )
    
    result = await crawler.arun(
        urls=[
            "https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/",
            "https://cloud.google.com/gpu",
            "https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/"
        ],
        optimizer=optimizer,
        optimization_mode="minimal_extraction"
    )
    
    print(f"Knowledge Coverage: {result.knowledge_coverage}")

    result = await agent.arun(
        goal="Find research papers about quantum computing published in 2023 with more than 50 citations",
        auto_retry=True
    )
    print("Generated Plan:", result.executed_steps)
    print("Extracted Data:", result.data)
    
    # Using custom steps with automatic execution
    result = await agent.arun(
        goal="Extract conference deadlines from ML conferences",
        custom_plan=[
            "Navigate to conference page",
            "Find important dates section",
            "Extract submission deadlines",
            "Verify dates are for 2024"
        ]
    )
    
    # Monitoring execution
    print("Step Completion:", result.step_status)

async with AsyncWebCrawler() as crawler:
    # Crawl and index content
    await index.build(
        urls=["https://docs.example.com"],
        crawler=crawler,
        options={
            "chunk_method": "semantic",
            "update_policy": "incremental",
            "embedding_batch_size": 100
        }
    )

    # Search through indexed content
    results = await index.search(
        query="How to implement OAuth authentication?",
        filters={
            "content_type": "technical",
            "recency": "6months"
        },
        top_k=5
    )

    # Get similar content
    similar = await index.find_similar(
        url="https://docs.example.com/auth/oauth",
        threshold=0.85
